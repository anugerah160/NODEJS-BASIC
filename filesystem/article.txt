Third: Delegate! 
Hold daily maintenance and be on-standby for her shift. It’s not urgent but important. If Sofia works in a team, she could delegate this task to another team member so that she can focus on the Quadrant 1 tasks first.
Attend her primary school virtual reunion tonight. This is not very important, but urgent because it must be attended tonight virtually.
Fourth: Drop! 
Catch up with the last 3 episodes of her favorite TV series. This is not important and not urgent as there are no benefits, and she can watch it another time since it’s a TV show.
